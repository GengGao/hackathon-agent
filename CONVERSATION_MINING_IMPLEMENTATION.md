## üì¶ Components Implemented

### 1. **Conversation Extractor** (`backend/extractors/conversation_extractor.py`)
**Purpose**: Extract insights from team conversations and chat history

**Categories Extracted**:
- `decisions_made` - Important decisions made by the team
- `technologies_chosen` - Technologies, frameworks, or tools selected
- `problems_solved` - Technical problems that were resolved
- `requirements_identified` - Project requirements discovered or clarified
- `blockers_encountered` - Obstacles or challenges that blocked progress
- `next_steps_planned` - Action items or next steps planned
- `ideas_generated` - Creative ideas or solutions proposed
- `resources_found` - Useful resources, links, or references discovered

**Key Features**:
- LangExtract integration with local Ollama (gemma2:2b)
- Fallback to heuristic methods when LangExtract unavailable
- Source text grounding with character positions
- Confidence scoring for each extraction
- Message-based processing for chat histories

### 2. **Progress Extractor** (`backend/extractors/progress_extractor.py`)
**Purpose**: Track project progress and development status

**Categories Extracted**:
- `completed_tasks` - Tasks or features that have been completed
- `current_blockers` - Current obstacles preventing progress
- `in_progress_tasks` - Tasks currently being worked on
- `planned_tasks` - Tasks planned for future work
- `milestone_updates` - Progress updates on major milestones
- `timeline_changes` - Changes to project timeline or deadlines
- `resource_needs` - Additional resources or help needed
- `risk_factors` - Potential risks or concerns identified

**Key Features**:
- Project health assessment (good/needs_attention/at_risk/excellent)
- Completion rate calculation
- Blocker severity analysis
- Timeline and milestone tracking

### 3. **LLM Tools** (`backend/tools/insight_tools.py`)
**Purpose**: Provide AI-callable functions for conversation analysis

**Available Tools**:
1. `get_conversation_insights` - Analyze conversation insights from chat history
2. `get_project_progress` - Analyze project progress and metrics
3. `get_focused_summary` - Get targeted summaries (decisions/blockers/progress/technologies)
4. `get_actionable_recommendations` - Generate prioritized recommendations
5. `analyze_team_decisions` - Focus on decision-making patterns
6. `track_problem_resolution` - Track problem-solving effectiveness

### 4. **Schema Definitions** (`backend/schemas/conversation_schemas.py`)
**Purpose**: Define extraction schemas and categories for structured output

### 5. **Few-Shot Examples** (`backend/examples/conversation_examples.py`)
**Purpose**: Training examples for LangExtract to improve extraction quality

## üéØ Real-World Usage Examples

### Example 1: Conversation Analysis
```python
# AI can now call this tool
result = get_conversation_insights(session_id="abc123")

# Returns structured insights like:
{
  "key_decisions": [
    {
      "decision": "let's go with React and FastAPI stack",
      "type": "technologies_chosen",
      "confidence": 0.95
    }
  ],
  "current_blockers": [
    {
      "blocker": "database migration is failing",
      "confidence": 0.88
    }
  ],
  "next_actions": [
    {
      "action": "need to have a backup plan for demo",
      "confidence": 0.82
    }
  ]
}
```

### Example 2: Progress Tracking
```python
# AI can analyze project health
result = get_project_progress(session_id="abc123")

# Returns progress metrics like:
{
  "completion_rate": 75.0,
  "project_health": "good",
  "completed_tasks": [
    {
      "task": "user authentication system",
      "completion_status": "fully_complete",
      "quality_indicator": "all tests passing"
    }
  ],
  "current_blockers": [
    {
      "blocker_type": "technical",
      "component": "database",
      "severity": "high"
    }
  ]
}
```

### Example 3: Actionable Recommendations
```python
# AI can provide smart recommendations
result = get_actionable_recommendations(session_id="abc123")

# Returns prioritized actions like:
{
  "recommendations": [
    {
      "type": "blocker_resolution",
      "priority": "high",
      "title": "Address Current Blockers",
      "description": "There are unresolved blockers that need attention"
    },
    {
      "type": "resource_allocation",
      "priority": "medium",
      "title": "Resource Requirements Identified"
    }
  ]
}
```

## üöÄ Integration with Existing System

### Tool Registry Integration
All 6 new tools are registered in `backend/tools/registry.py` and available for LLM use:

- ‚úÖ `get_conversation_insights`
- ‚úÖ `get_project_progress`
- ‚úÖ `get_focused_summary`
- ‚úÖ `get_actionable_recommendations`
